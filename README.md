# Real-Time Data-Driven Decisions

This project simulates a real-time data pipeline using **Apache Spark Structured Streaming** and visualizes the processed data in a live dashboard using **Streamlit**.  
It is part of my specialization at **Mackenzie University** in the course *"Data-Driven Decision Making in Real Time"*.

The goal is to demonstrate how decisions can be guided by data — structured or unstructured — through an end-to-end pipeline from data ingestion to real-time decision support.

Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Apache Spark** (Structured Streaming)
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas**
- **Faker** (for generating realistic fake data)
- **Docker** (optional: containerizing Spark or simulating Kafka)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for exploratory analysis)
